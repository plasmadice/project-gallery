# Herman's Project Portfolip/Gallery

[View this repository live.](https://plasmadice.github.io/project-gallery/)

The purpose of this repository is to gather some of my smaller projects together as well as to practice maintaining a repository. This will be regularly updated and improved.

My first iteration of the landing page died in a tragic git rm -r -f accident. Lessons were learned.

The landing page is made using bootstrap.
